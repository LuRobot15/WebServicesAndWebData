<h1>News agency API and client</h1>
<h2>project description</h2>
<p>The coursework required us to impliment a Django web API to allow the creation, deletion and storage of news articles. Our API was registered with a directory service containing the APIs from everyone on the course.</p>
<p>We were also required to submit a Python client app that could use the API to create and delete news articles, as well as view articles from all APIs in the directory. The client was a command line app.</p>
