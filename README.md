The coursework required us to impliment a Django web API to allow the creation, deletion and storage of news articles. Our API was registered with a directory service containing the APIs from everyone on the course. 
We were also required to submit a Python client app that could use the API to create and delete news articles, as well as view articles from all APIs in the directory. The client was a command line app.

The cw1 folder contains all work submitted for the 1st coursework of my Web services and web data module.

The coursework1_project folder contains the Django API
The client_app folder contains all other code required for the coursework.
client.py contains the client app.
register_client.py contains the script used to register the client with the directory service.
test_newsapp.py is a program used to test the API before it was registered.
